Through my past professional experiences, I've been tasked with devising technological solutions that meet needs whilst working with previously unexperienced programming languages, like Ansible Tower and Jenkins Pipeline.</p>\n<p>I'm currently a Junior, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, as a student in the Rutgers Engineering Honors Academy. I myself am a newcomer to computer science, but in a little over 3 semesters of coursework, I believe I've developed into an avid programmer that can quickly learn new skills and apply them with ease. This can be attributed to my desire to never be idle and to constantly be challenged through school or exploratory side projects. My engineering knowledge and coding skills have helped me appreciate computers and the beautiful potential within.</p>\n<!-- Shortly after graduating from [Northeastern University](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/) in the spring of 2018, I joined [Upstatement](https://www.upstatement.com/) on the engineering team and have continued honing my skills.
